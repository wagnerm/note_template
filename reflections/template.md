# Reflection template for: MONTH HERE

Every Friday, I schedule a 15 min calendar event where I will open a reflection note and write down details for each section.

I create a new reflection note every month so they do not become cluttered and there is logical separate between months.

## What do I like about the previous month?

## What do I want to change from the previous month?

## What have I done this month and what was the impact? Be detailed!
