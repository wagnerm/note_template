# Note Template

In my contining journey to figure out the best way to document day to day issues, learnings, my activities, etc, I've assemble some templates for the notes that I take.

My workflow is my own and is constantly evolving and growing. Ultimately though, I strive to write down everything so that I don't have to retain lot of information in my head and I can find what I need really quickly!
